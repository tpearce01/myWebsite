                      <b>Programming</b> - With this project I really wanted to re-create some basic systems from third-person RPGs. I wanted the camera and movement to feel
                      like World of Warcraft. Moving the camera with the mouse was more complicated than I initially believed, but I learned a lot by
                      doing it. Using Tab to target enemies was also a fun obstacle to overcome. To overcome these challenges I learned a lot about
                      cameras, viewports, and Renderers in Unity
                  </li>
                  <br />
                  <li>
                      <b>Design</b> - The biggest challenge I had was getting the players to know the controls. Players don't read the tutorial page, as expected, so the
                      controls need to be obvious. I iterated through many different UI designs ranging from too little information to having too much information
                      before settling on my final design. Finding the right balance was difficult, but absolutely worth the effort.

              <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
              <li>
                  <b>Programming</b> - I was able to build this game in just a few hours because I was able 
                  to bring in pieces of modular code I have written for my other projects. It's really
                  rewarding to see how a small extra bit of work one day can save many hours in the future.
              </li>
              <li><b>Design</b> - It was surprising how significantly the difficulty changed by altering
                  minor design variables. Every value had to be modified and tested through several iterations
                    to find a combination that was engaging, fun, and challenging.</li>
